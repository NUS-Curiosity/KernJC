    selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails


    When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(),

    h->size is left initialized with a non-zero value, but the h->htable

    pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since

    the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed

    hashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called

    on it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.


    Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid

    empty hashtab when the allocation fails.'
