    scsi: lpfc: Fix link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference


    If an FC link down transition while PLOGIs are outstanding to fabric well

    known addresses, outstanding ABTS requests may result in a NULL pointer

    dereference. Driver unload requests may hang with repeated "2878" log

    messages.


    The Link down processing results in ABTS requests for outstanding ELS

    requests. The Abort WQEs are sent for the ELSs before the driver had set

    the link state to down. Thus the driver is sending the Abort with the

    expectation that an ABTS will be sent on the wire. The Abort request is

    stalled waiting for the link to come up. In some conditions the driver may

    auto-complete the ELSs thus if the link does come up, the Abort completions

    may reference an invalid structure.


    Fix by ensuring that Abort set the flag to avoid link traffic if issued due

    to conditions where the link failed.'
