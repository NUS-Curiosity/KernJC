  value: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:


    iavf: free q_vectors before queues in iavf_disable_vf


    iavf_free_queues() clears adapter->num_active_queues, which

    iavf_free_q_vectors() relies on, so swap the order of these two function

    calls in iavf_disable_vf(). This resolves a panic encountered when the

    interface is disabled and then later brought up again after PF

    communication is restored.'
