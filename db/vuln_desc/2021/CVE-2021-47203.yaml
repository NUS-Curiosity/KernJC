    scsi: lpfc: Fix list_add() corruption in lpfc_drain_txq()


    When parsing the txq list in lpfc_drain_txq(), the driver attempts to pass

    the requests to the adapter. If such an attempt fails, a local "fail_msg"

    string is set and a log message output.  The job is then added to a

    completions list for cancellation.


    Processing of any further jobs from the txq list continues, but since

    "fail_msg" remains set, jobs are added to the completions list regardless

    of whether a wqe was passed to the adapter.  If successfully added to

    txcmplq, jobs are added to both lists resulting in list corruption.


    Fix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to the completions

    list. This stops the subsequent jobs from being added to the completions

    list unless they had an appropriate failure.'
